To run the software as a standalone shiny application, double click "run.bat" and this should trigger the 
necessary files.

If the software does not load, the important R files are in the folder
"shiny/wrk/" 

All R code available in this package can be used freely, acknowledging 
that it was developed for research purposes and thus carries no 
guarantees of effectiveness beyond the examples described in the 
previously noted manuscript.
